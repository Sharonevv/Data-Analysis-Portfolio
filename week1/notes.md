# Week 1 - Day 1 Notes

## Lessons Covered
- [Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction)
- [Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (WHERE)](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints)
- [Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (text patterns)](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints_pt_2)

## Key Takeaways
- `SELECT column FROM table;` is the core of retrieving data.
- `WHERE` filters rows based on conditions.
- Text matching can use:
  - `=` for exact matches
  - `LIKE 'pattern%'` for starts with
  - `LIKE '%pattern%'` for contains
  - `_` matches a single character in LIKE patterns
- `!=` means "not equal to".

## Reflections
I can now extract specific columns, filter by numbers, and filter text using patterns.
