# Sharone's Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
I’m Sharone, a Computer Science graduate from NUST, based in Windhoek, Namibia. I'm building my portfolio through practical SQL, Excel, and Power BI projects tied to real world data and clear documentation.

## Portfolio Projects

### SQL
- **Week 1–Day 1**: Basic SELECT queries — retrieving film titles, directors, etc.  
  (see `week1/week1_day1.sql` for details)
- **Week 1–Day 2**: Sorting, filtering, and basic joins.  
  (see `week1/day2.sql`)

## - **Week 1–[Day1](https://thelinkgoeshere.com)**: SQL Basics
**Goal:**  I Learned about and practiced SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and basic JOINs.
(see `week1/week1_day1.sql` for details)
- **Week 1–[Day2](https://thelinkgoeshere.com)**: I Learned about and practiced Sorting, filtering, and basic joins.
