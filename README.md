# Sharone's Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
"Hello world!" I’m Sharone Boois, a Data Analyst and Programmer. I graduated from NUST with the Bachelor of Computer Science NQF 7, based in Windhoek, Namibia. I'm building my portfolio through practical SQL, Excel, and Power BI projects tied to real world data and clear documentation.

## Portfolio Projects

### SQL
- **Week 1–Day 1**: Basic `SELECT` queries — retrieving film titles, directors, etc.  
  
- **Week 1–Day 2**: Sorting, filtering, and basic joins (`INNER JOIN`).
  
- **Week 1–Day 3**: `OUTER JOINs`, `NULL` logic, and expressions.

- **Week 1–Day 4**: SQL aggregate functions `(MAX, AVG, SUM, and COUNT)` and the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clause. 

- **Week 1–Day 5**: Order of Execution, Inserting Rows, Updating Rows, Deleting Rows

- **Week 1- Day6**: Creating tables, Altering tables and Dropping tables


## - **Week 1-Day 1**
I learned about and practiced The `SELECT` statement, `WHERE` clause, `AND` `OR` Logical operators and the LIKE operator.
(see [Week1 Day1](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day1.sql) for details)

## - **Week 1–Day 2**
I learned about and practiced Sorting, filtering, and basic joins (the INNER JOIN) on real world data. 
  (see [Week1 Day2](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day2.sql) for details)

## - **Week 1–Day 3**
I learned and practiced OUTER JOINs, NULL logic, and expressions on real world data. 
(see [Week1 Day3](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day3.sql) for details) 

## - **Week 1-Day 4**
I learned and practiced using SQL aggregate functions like MAX, AVG, SUM, and COUNT to summarize data. I also applied GROUP BY and HAVING with these functions to analyze roles, buildings, and employee categories more effectively.
 (see [Week1 Day4](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day4.sql) for details)

## - **Week 1 Day 5**
I learned about SQL’s execution order, learned how to safely update and delete data, and practiced creating tables with proper constraints. These lessons showed me how to manipulate and structure data like a real-world analyst.
(see [Week1 Day5](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day5.sql) for details)

## - **Week1 Day 6**
This was was my conclusion to the SQLbolt Beginner Lessons and practice exercises I learned how to Create tables, Altering within tables and Dropping within tables in the database. (see [Week1_Day6](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_%20day6.sql) for details)
