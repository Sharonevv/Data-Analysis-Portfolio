# Sharone's Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
"Hello world!", I’m Sharone Boois, a Computer Science graduate from NUST, based in Windhoek, Namibia. I'm building my portfolio through practical SQL, Excel, and Power BI projects tied to real world data and clear documentation.

## Portfolio Projects

### SQL
- **Week 1–Day 1**: Basic SELECT queries — retrieving film titles, directors, etc.  
  
- **Week 1–Day 2**: Sorting, filtering, and basic joins (INNER JOIN).
  
- **Week 1–Day 3**: OUTER JOINs, NULL logic, and expressions.

- **Week 1–Day 4**: SQL aggregate functions (MAX, AVG, SUM, and COUNT) and the GROUP BY and HAVING clause. 

- **Week 1–Day 5**: 

## - **Week 1-Day 1**
I learned about and practiced The SELECT statement, WHERE clause, AND OR Logical operators and the LIKE operator.
(see [Week1 Day1](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day1.sql) for details)

## - **Week 1–Day 2**
I learned about and practiced Sorting, filtering, and basic joins (the INNER JOIN) on real world data. 
  (see [Week1 Day2](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day2.sql) for details)

## - **Week 1–Day 3**
I learned and practiced OUTER JOINs, NULL logic, and expressions on real world data. 
(see [Week1 Day3](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day3.sql) for details) 

## - **Week 1-Day 4**
I learned and practiced using SQL aggregate functions like MAX, AVG, SUM, and COUNT to summarize data. I also applied GROUP BY and HAVING with these functions to analyze roles, buildings, and employee categories more effectively.
 (see [Week1 Day4](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/week1/week1_day4.sql) for details)


### Files
- All of [week1](https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/week1) sample queries from practice can be found here as well as week 1 [notes]( https://github.com/Sharonevv/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/week1/notes.md ) which shows all table content of the day by day activity that I did and what I learned everyday.  


### Excel
*(Coming soon – building dashboards and pivot tables)*

### Power BI
*(Coming later in the learning plan)*
