# Sharone's Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
"Hello world!", I’m Sharone, a Computer Science graduate from NUST, based in Windhoek, Namibia. I'm building my portfolio through practical SQL, Excel, and Power BI projects tied to real world data and clear documentation.

## Portfolio Projects

### SQL
- **Week 1–Day 1**: Basic SELECT queries — retrieving film titles, directors, etc.  
  
- **Week 1–Day 2**: Sorting, filtering, and basic joins (INNER JOIN).  

## - **Week 1-Day1**: SQL Basics
**Goal:**  I Learned about and practiced The SELECT statement, WHERE clause, AND OR Logical operators and the LIKE operator.
